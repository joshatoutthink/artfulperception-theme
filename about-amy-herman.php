                        Amy Herman is a lawyer and art historian who uses works of art to sharpen observation, analysis,
                        and communication skills. By showing people how to look closely at painting, sculpture, and
                        photography, she helps them hone their visual intelligence to recognize the most pertinent and
                        useful information as well as recognize biases that impede decision making. She developed her
                        Art of Perception seminar in 2000 to improve medical students' observation and communication
                        skills with their patients when she was the Head of Education at The Frick Collection in New York
                        City. She subsequently adapted the program for a wide range of professionals and leads
                        sessions internationally for the New York City Police Department, the FBI, the French National
                        Police, the Department of Defense, Interpol, the State Department, Fortune 500 companies, first
                        responders, the military, and the intelligence community. In her highly participatory presentation,
                        she demonstrates the relevance of visual literacy across the professional spectrum and how the
                        analysis of works of art affords participants in her program an innovative way to refresh their
                        sense of critical inquiry and reconsider the skills necessary for improved performance and
                        effective leadership. The program has been featured in <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>The Wall Street
                        Journal</i>, <i>The CBS Evening News</i>, and <i>Smithsonian Magazine</i>, among others. Her TED talk, <i>A
                        Lesson in Looking</i>, went live in December 2018. Ms. Herman holds an A.B., a J.D., and an M.A.
                        in art history. Her book, <i>Visual Intelligence</i>, was published in May 2016 and was on both the <i>New
                        York Times</i> and <i>Washington Post</i> best sellers' lists.
